# Naive Bayes for Student Success
**Assignment 1 for COMP90049 Semester 1, 2020.
<br />Lecturer: Dr Lea Frermann and Dr Qiuhong Ke**

Building a Naive Bayes classifier based on a student record file to analyse the correlation between students' behaviours and performance.

<br />The program reads the csv file and implements a self-built Naive Bayes model to return predictions. The predictions can be compared against actual labels to obtain metrics such as accuracy, recall, precision, and f-score.

<br />The program supports both train-test subset split and cross validation methods for evaluation.
